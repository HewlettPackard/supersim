Winner take all switch allocation
-packet based, implement in crossbar scheduler

Traditional multi-VC 1x input speedup allocation
-allocator different (how to make general policy?)

Variable crossbar input speedup
-pre(or) and port(arb&and) processing of core allocator

Variable crossbar output speedup
-HOW TO WIRE THIS UP?

Multi-frequency designs
-speedup via frequency

Automatic VC quantity calculation
-packet/protocol class
-routing class
-virtual links

Adaptive Routing
-routing bits in packet
-move "routing" in JSON to "network"
-interface routing function, or option in regular one
-router provides link congestion state
