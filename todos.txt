Traditional multi-VC 1x input speedup allocation
-allocator different (how to make general policy?)

Variable crossbar input speedup
-pre(or) and port(arb&and) processing of core allocator

Variable crossbar output speedup
-This is doable because only a single VC can be allocated at one time.

Automatic VC quantity calculation
-packet/protocol class
-routing class
-virtual links

Multiple simultaneous applications
-basic desire is to have background traffic (stresstest)
  then introduce another traffic pattern (hotspot)

Torus Topology Weights
-Just like HyperX is a flexible version of Fbfly, make Torus have weights

VC Scheduler Queue Eligibility Masking
-Create an optional setting to mask off requests where buffer space is insufficient
-Consider using a threshold for deciding 'insufficient'
